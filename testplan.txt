DUMB is a mail service in which all users have access to all inboxes in the box
A box is the collection of inboxes held in the server
An inbox is a collection of messages stored in a queue
	Note: NXTMG gets the next message and removes it from the queue

Extra Credit Patch: Within open on the server, ensured the client cannot have more than one message box open at a time
		    -If a client tries to open another message box while one is already open, our server will close the current
		    before opening the intended message box.
